	// achieve the heap size goals set by GCPercent and
	// MaxHeapBytes.
	//
	// For example, if AvailGCPercent is 100, then at the end of
	// the previous garbage collection, the space available for
	// allocation before the next GC was the same as the space
	// used. If AvailGCPercent is 20, then the space available is

	// not under pressure and can amortize the cost of garbage
	// collection by allowing the heap to grow in proportion to
	// how much is used.
	//
	// If AvailGCPercent < GCPercent, the garbage collector is
	// under pressure and must run more frequently to keep the
	// heap size under MaxHeapBytes. Smaller values of
	// AvailGCPercent indicate greater pressure. In this case, the

	// to relieve memory pressure.

// SetMaxHeap sets a soft limit on the size of the Go heap and returns
// the previous setting. By default, there is no limit.
//
// If a max heap is set, the garbage collector will endeavor to keep
// the heap size under the specified size, even if this is lower than
// would normally be determined by GOGC (see SetGCPercent).
//
// Whenever the garbage collector's scheduling policy changes as a
// result of this heap limit (that is, the result that would be
// returned by ReadGCPolicy changes), the garbage collector will send
// to the notify channel. This is a non-blocking send, so this should
// be a single-element buffered channel, though this is not required.
// Only a single channel may be registered for notifications at a
// time; SetMaxHeap replaces any previously registered channel.
//
// The application is strongly encouraged to respond to this
// notification by calling ReadGCPolicy and, if AvailGCPercent is less
// than GCPercent, shedding load to reduce its live heap size. Setting
// a maximum heap size limits the garbage collector's ability to
// amortize the cost of garbage collection when the heap reaches the
// heap size limit. This is particularly important in
// request-processing systems, where increasing pressure on the
// garbage collector reduces CPU time available to the application,
// making it less able to complete work, leading to even more pressure
// on the garbage collector. The application must shed load to avoid
// this "GC death spiral".
//
// The limit set by SetMaxHeap is soft. If the garbage collector would
// consume too much CPU to keep the heap under this limit (leading to
// "thrashing"), it will allow the heap to grow larger than the
// specified max heap.
//
// The heap size does not include everything in the process's memory
// footprint. Notably, it does not include stacks, C-allocated memory,
// or many runtime-internal structures.
//
// To disable the heap limit, pass ^uintptr(0) for the bytes argument.
// In this case, notify can be nil.
